# Backend Development Explained

In web development, the backend refers to the server-side of applications, where the logic, data processing, and database interactions occur.

## Server

A server is a computer or software that provides functionality to other programs or devices, known as clients, within a network. In the context of backend development:

-  **Web Server:** A type of server responsible for delivering web content, such as HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and media files, to clients (usually web browsers) upon request.
-  **Application Server:** A server responsible for executing the business logic of an application and providing data to the client-side of the application (e.g., web browser or mobile app) upon request.

## Application

An application, also known as a web application or software application, is a program or software designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end-users. In the context of backend development:

-  **Backend Application:** The backend application, also referred to as the server-side application, is responsible for processing client requests, executing business logic, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content to be sent to the client-side of the application.

## Database

A database is an organized collection of structured data stored and managed electronically in a computer system. In the context of backend development:

-  **Database Management System (DBMS):** A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
-  **Backend Database:** The backend database stores and manages the structured data required for the operation of the application. It stores user information, application data, settings, and other relevant data required by the backend application.
